  - name: Evolutionary Circuit
    icon: 🌀
    cost: 10 Malice
    effects:
      - effect: All voiceless talkers link their minds, creating a circuit that empowers
          them while two or more voiceless talkers remain in the encounter.
          While this circuit is active, any psionic strike made by a voiceless
          talker deals an extra 5 damage. Additionally, when a non-minion
          voiceless talker takes damage, they can use a free triggered action to
          swap places with any voiceless talker minion on the encounter map. The
          minion takes the damage instead.
