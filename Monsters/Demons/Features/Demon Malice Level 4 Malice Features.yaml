      - effect: One demon acting this turn folds space around them, temporarily slipping
          in and out of the Abyssal Wasteland. Until the start of the demon's
          next turn, they ignore difficult terrain, can move through solid
          matter, and don't provoke opportunity attacks by moving. If the demon
          ends their turn inside solid matter, they are shunted out into the
          space from which they entered it.
