        effect: The area is filled with a green haze that lasts until the start of the
          stinker's next turn or until the stinker is reduced to 0 Stamina, and
          which can't be dispersed by wind. The area is difficult terrain for
          non-goblins, and each non-goblin who moves in the area takes 2 poison
          damage for each square moved.
